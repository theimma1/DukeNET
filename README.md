# 🌐 AINet: The AI Internet - Foundational Protocols for Autonomous Agents

## Project Vision

The AINet ecosystem will provide the foundational protocols for AI agent communication. Our vision is building the foundational infrastructure layer where AI agents communicate, collaborate, and transact—creating the next-generation internet for artificial intelligence.

Just as TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP enabled the modern web, AINet provides the foundational protocols and runtime for the global AI agent economy.

## 🛠️ The Six Core Architectural Components

The AINet ecosystem is built around six tightly integrated, modular components.

| Layer | Component | Analogy | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protocol Layer** | **AICP** (AI Communication Protocol) | TCP/IP | Standardized agent-to-agent messaging, security, and performance. |
| | **AINS** (AI Naming System) | DNS | Global directory service for agent identity, capability discovery, and trust. |
| | **AITP** (AI Task Protocol) | HTTP | Defines how agents request, orchestrate, execute, and track complex multi-step tasks. |
| **Runtime Layer** | **AgentOS** (Agent Operating System) | Web Browser | The runtime environment providing abstractions for memory management, communication, and resource allocation. |
| | **Node Network** | Web Server | The distributed compute mesh for agent execution, offering multi-tiered compute resources (Cloud, Edge, IoT). |
| **Economic Layer** | **AINet Marketplace** | App Store | The platform enabling agents to discover, purchase, and monetize capabilities (agents, skills, data, compute). |

## 👑 The Flagship: Labelee Duke

The **Labelee Duke Model** is our hero agent and flagship product.

* **Strategic Role:** It acts as the primary user interface and the core **Orchestrator Agent**, coordinating complex multi-agent workflows using AITP.
* **Core Technology:** Duke is a modular, research-grade multimodal AI that unites image and text representations. It fuses visual and textual data for classification, retrieval, and embedding alignment. This allows it to seamlessly integrate perception and semantics to reason about tasks.
* **Integration:** Duke utilizes all six AINet components—from AICP for communication to the Marketplace for purchasing capabilities on-demand.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

This project is modular and uses multiple languages to match its distributed goals. We welcome expertise across all components.

### 1. Contribution Focus Areas

| Repository (Conceptual) | Primary Language | Contribution Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ainet/aicp-core` | Rust / Python | Low-latency protocol implementation, security (mTLS, Ed25519). |
| `ainet/agentos-sdk` | Python / JavaScript | Memory management systems, Skill Registry, resource allocation API. |
| `ainet/duke-agent` | Python / ML Frameworks | Multi-agent orchestration logic, task decomposition, real-time learning. |
| `ainet/node-network` | Go / Kubernetes | Distributed node discovery, intelligent task placement, sandboxed execution. |

### 2. Immediate Needs (Q1 Focus)

We are currently prioritizing the foundation of the network:

* **Protocol Implementation:** Writing the **AICP Protocol Specification** (RFC-style document) and implementing the basic message structure and authentication layer.
* **Identity System:** Designing the **AINS Agent Identity Record** schema and building the capability discovery API.
* **DevOps/Infrastructure:** Configuring the CI/CD pipeline and setting up monitoring and logging tools.

### 3. Standards and Method

* **Development Method:** We utilize the **Scrum methodology** for iterative development, with Year 1 Q1 focusing on core protocol and legal setup.
* **Logging & Progress:** All training and code preparation scripts **must include logging and progress bars**.
* **Code Quality:** Establish coding standards and review processes.
